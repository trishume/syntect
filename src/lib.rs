//! Welcome to the syntect docs.
//!
//! Much more info about syntect is available on the [Github Page](https://github.com/trishume/syntect).
//!
//! May I suggest that you start by reading the `Readme.md` file in the main repo.
//! Once you're done with that you can look at the docs for [`parsing::SyntaxSet`]
//! and for the [`easy`] module.
//!
//! Almost everything in syntect is divided up into either the [`parsing`] module
//! for turning text into text annotated with scopes, and the [`highlighting`] module
//! for turning annotated text into styled/colored text.
//!
//! Some docs have example code but a good place to look is the `syncat` example as
//! well as the source code for the [`easy`] module in `easy.rs` as that shows how to
//! plug the various parts together for common use cases.
//!
//! [`parsing::SyntaxSet`]: parsing/struct.SyntaxSet.html
//! [`easy`]: easy/index.html
//! [`parsing`]: parsing/index.html
//! [`highlighting`]: highlighting/index.html
