//! Methods for dumping serializable structs to a compressed binary format
//! These are used to load and store the dumps used for fast startup times.
//!
//! Currently syntect serializes `SyntaxSet` structs with `dump_to_file`
//! into `.packdump` files and likewise `ThemeSet` structs to `.themedump` files.
//!
//! You can use these methods to manage your own caching of compiled syntaxes and
//! themes. And even your own `serde::Serialize` structures if you want to
//! be consistent with your format.
