## [Version 4.0.0](https://github.com/trishume/syntect/compare/v3.3.0...v4.0.0) (2020-03-29)

### Headline feature: pure-Rust `fancy-regex` engine option

Users can now opt in to a pure-Rust regex engine using Cargo features, making
compilation easier in general. People experiencing difficulty compiling for
Windows and Wasm should try switching to `fancy-regex`. Note this currently
approximately halves highlighting speed.

See the Readme and [#270](https://github.com/trishume/syntect/pull/270) for details.
Thanks to @robinst for implementing this!

### Other changes

- Ability to generate CSS for a theme for use with classed HTML generation (won't always be correct) [#274](https://github.com/trishume/syntect/pull/274/files)
- Don't generate empty spans in classed HTML [#276](https://github.com/trishume/syntect/pull/276)
- Miscellaneous dependency bumps and cleanup

### Breaking changes and upgrading

Upgrading should cause no errors for nearly all users. Users using more unusual APIs may have a small amount of tweaking to do.

- If you use `default-features = false` you may need to update your features to choose a regex engine
- A bunch of technically public APIs that I don't know if anyone uses changed due to the regex engine refactor, common uses shouldn't break

## [Version 3.0.0](https://github.com/trishume/syntect/compare/v2.1.0...v3.0.0) (2018-10-09)

> Breaking changes and major new features

This is a major release with multiple breaking API changes, although upgrading shouldn't be too difficult. It fixes bugs and comes with some nice new features.

### Breaking changes and upgrading

- The `SyntaxSet` API has been revamped to use a builder and an arena of contexts. See [example usage](https://github.com/trishume/syntect/blob/51208d35a6d98c07468fbe044d5c6f37eb129205/examples/gendata.rs#L25-L28).
- Many functions now need to be passed the `SyntaxSet` that goes with the rest of their arguments because of this new arena.
- Filename added to `LoadingError::ParseSyntax`
- Many functions in the `html` module now take the `newlines` version of syntaxes.
  - These methods have also been renamed, partially so that code that needs updating doesn't break without a compile error.
  - The HTML they output also treats newlines slightly differently and I think more correctly but uglier when you look at the HTML.

#### Breaking rename upgrade guide

- `SyntaxSet::add_syntax -> SyntaxSetBuilder::add`
- `SyntaxSet::load_syntaxes -> SyntaxSetBuilder::add_from_folder`
- `SyntaxSet::load_plain_text_syntax -> SyntaxSetBuilder::add_plain_text_syntax`
- `html::highlighted_snippet_for_string -> html::highlighted_html_for_string`: also change to `newlines` `SyntaxSet`
- `html::highlighted_snippet_for_file -> html::highlighted_html_for_file`: also change to `newlines` `SyntaxSet`
- `html::styles_to_coloured_html -> html::styled_line_to_highlighted_html`: also change to `newlines` `SyntaxSet`
- `html::start_coloured_html_snippet -> html::start_highlighted_html_snippet`: return type also changed

### Major changes and new features

- Use arena for contexts ([#182](https://github.com/trishume/syntect/pull/182) [#186](https://github.com/trishume/syntect/pull/186) [#187](https://github.com/trishume/syntect/pull/187) [#190](https://github.com/trishume/syntect/pull/190) [#195](https://github.com/trishume/syntect/pull/195)): This makes the code cleaner, enables use of syntaxes from multiple threads, and prevents accidental misuse.
  - This involves a new `SyntaxSetBuilder` API for constructing new `SyntaxSet`s
  - See the revamped [parsyncat example](https://github.com/trishume/syntect/blob/51208d35a6d98c07468fbe044d5c6f37eb129205/examples/parsyncat.rs).
- Encourage use of newlines ([#197](https://github.com/trishume/syntect/pull/197) [#207](https://github.com/trishume/syntect/pull/207) [#196](https://github.com/trishume/syntect/issues/196)): The `nonewlines` mode is often buggy so we made it easier to use the `newlines` mode.
  - Added a `LinesWithEndings` utility for iterating over the lines of a string with `\n` characters.
  - Reengineer the `html` module to use `newlines` syntaxes.
- Add helpers for modifying highlighted lines ([#198](https://github.com/trishume/syntect/pull/198)): For use cases like highlighting a piece of text in a blog code snippet or debugger. This allows you to reach into the highlighted spans and add styles.
  - Check out `split_at` and `modify_range` in the `util` module.
- New `ThemeSet::add_from_folder` function ([#200](https://github.com/trishume/syntect/pull/200)): For modifying existing theme sets.

### Bug Fixes

- Improve nonewlines regex rewriting: [#212](https://github.com/trishume/syntect/pull/212) [#211](https://github.com/trishume/syntect/issues/211)
- Reengineer theme application to match Sublime: [#209](https://github.com/trishume/syntect/pull/209)
- Also mark contexts referenced by name as "no prototype" (same as ST): [#180](https://github.com/trishume/syntect/pull/180)
- keep with_prototype when switching contexts with `set`: [#177](https://github.com/trishume/syntect/pull/177) [#166](https://github.com/trishume/syntect/pull/166)
- Fix unused import warning: [#174](https://github.com/trishume/syntect/pull/174)
- Ignore trailing dots in selectors: [#173](https://github.com/trishume/syntect/pull/173)
- Fix `embed` to not include prototypes: [#172](https://github.com/trishume/syntect/pull/172) [#160](https://github.com/trishume/syntect/issues/160)

* Can detect the correct syntax on full file names like `CMakeLists.txt`
* Make `nonewlines` mode marginally less buggy (still prefer using `newlines` mode)
* Better error types
* Better examples and tests

## [Version 2.0.1](https://github.com/trishume/syntect/compare/v2.0.0...v2.0.1) (2018-04-28)

> More robust parsing

* Parsing now abandons a regex after reaching a recursion depth limit instead of taking forever
* Loop detection better matches Sublime Text
* Parsing is faster!
* Dependency upgrades
* Other minor tweaks

Thanks to [@robinst](https://github.com/ronbinst) for the headline features of this release!

## [Version 2.0.0](https://github.com/trishume/syntect/compare/v1.8.2...v2.0.0) (2018-01-02)

> Breaking Changes and New Stuff

### Breaking changes

## [Version 1.8.0](https://github.com/trishume/syntect/compare/v1.7.3...v1.8.0) (2017-10-14)

> Update bitflags & packages

This release changes how the constants for `FontStyle` and `Color`, relying on the new associated consts feature in `Rust 1.20`. The old constants are still available but are deprecated and will be removed in `v2.0`.

Packages were also updated to newer versions.

## [Version 1.7.3](https://github.com/trishume/syntect/compare/v1.7.2...v1.7.3) (2017-09-15)

> Enable comparison of parse states

Fixes comparisons of parse states so they are fast and don't recurse infinitely. Thanks [@raphlinus](https://github.com/raphlinus)

## [Version 1.7.2](https://github.com/trishume/syntect/compare/v1.7.0...v1.7.2) (2017-09-05)

## [Version 1.4.0](https://github.com/trishume/syntect/compare/v1.3.0...v1.4.0) (2017-05-25)

> Serde and optional parsing

This release switches the dump format from `rustc-serialize` to `Serde`, anyone using custom dumps will have to update them.

It also makes the parsing part of the library optional behind a feature flag, anyone not using the default feature flags probably will want to add the `parsing` flag.

## [Version 1.3.0](https://github.com/trishume/syntect/tree/v1.3.0) (2017-04-05)

> Bug fixes, tests, updates and feature flags

* Syntax tests: there is a new `syntest` example for running Sublime Text syntax tests
* Bug fixes: there's a ton of bugs fixed in this release, mostly found via the syntax tests. These mostly affected certain syntaxes which pushed/set multiple contexts at once.
* Updated packages: The Sublime packages have been updated to the latest version
* Feature flags: there's now Cargo feature flags for disabling some parts of syntect if you don't want unnecessary binary and dependency bloat.
